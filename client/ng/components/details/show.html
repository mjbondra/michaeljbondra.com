<h2 data-send-pageview data-set-title>Hello!</h2>
<p data-set-description>
  My name is Michael J. Bondra, and I create high-quality experiences for the web's users and makers.
</p>
<p>
  I am a full-stack engineer who has been developing websites and applications for more than fifteen years. In that
  time I have seen the web transform from a blinking, scrolling, table-filled, frame-organized, perl-script-driven
  guestbook, to a world of respectable architectures and unquestioned utility.
</p>
<h3>JavaScript</h3>
<p>
  I am primarily a JavaScript developer. The
  <a href="//www.w3.org/community/webed/wiki/A_Short_History_of_JavaScript" target="_blank">hastily devised language</a>
  is far from perfect &mdash; an obvious statement for those who have lived through the nightmares of loaded operators,
  unintuitive coercion, and <em>0.1 + 0.2 != 0.3</em>. But a server-side runtime, evolving standards, and a myriad of
  excellent frameworks have given new life to the imperfect child of necessity.
</p>
<p>
  The rise of <a href="//nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node.js</a> has given JavaScript a reliable engine upon
  which complex applications can be built. The preeminent framework used for developing these applications is
  <a href="http://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">Express</a>. It abstracts away the complexity of handling the
  request-response cycle with the powerful concept of sequentially executed functions known as <em>middleware</em>.
  The <a href="http://koajs.com/" target="_blank">Koa</a> framework will undoubtedly inherit the success of Express, and
  not just because they share an overlapping set of contributors. Koa extends the concept of middleware by layering
  functions known as generators, which can yield their execution to other generators, functions, and objects, before
  resuming their own.
</p>
<p>
  On the front-end, <a href="//jquery.com/" target="_blank">JQuery</a> has long been the standard by virtue of its
  simple, intuitive API for interacting with HTML documents. Utilities like
  <a href="http://underscorejs.org/" target="_blank">Underscore</a> and
  <a href="//lodash.com/" target="_blank">Lo-Dash</a> have provided additional tools that can supplement any library or
  framework. But most exciting has been the advent of libraries and frameworks like
  <a href="//angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a>,
  <a href="http://emberjs.com/" target="_blank">Ember</a>,
  <a href="http://backbonejs.org/" target="_blank">Backbone.js</a>,
  <a href="//facebook.github.io/flux/" target="_blank">Flux</a>, and
  <a href="//facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank">React</a>, with AngularJS and React having perhaps the greatest
  mindshare of this latest generation. AngularJS is complete framework that extends HTML as a templating language, with
  powerful two-way data-binding that synchronizes values between the document and the underlying JavaScript engine.
  React is an ultra-performative library that focuses on creating abstractions for interface functionality, and is often
  paired with another library or framework, namely Flux.

<h3>Et Cetera, Et Alii</h3>
<p>
  When I am not developing, you might find me exploring Ann Arbor with my long-time partner, Vanessa, and our
  five-year-old German Shepherd mix, Stella. Being an avid homebrewer, you might also see me brewing a crisp session
  ale, or tending to my urban hops garden.
</p>
<p>
  Not long ago I earned my second degree from the University of Michigan &mdash; an MSI in Human-Computer Interaction
  to go with my BA in Social Anthropology. While I take pride in my academic achievements, I take even greater pride in
  my passion, and the attention to detail that put into everything that I do.
